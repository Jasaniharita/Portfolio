## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   - Make sure all your files are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository

2. **Sign up/Login to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up or login (you can use your GitHub account)

3. **Import your project**
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a static site

4. **Configure and Deploy**
   - Framework Preset: **Other** (or leave as default)
   - Root Directory: `./` (root)
   - Build Command: Leave empty (no build needed for static site)
   - Output Directory: Leave empty (or `./`)
   - Click **Deploy**

5. **Your site is live!**
   - Vercel will provide you with a URL like `your-project.vercel.app`
   - You can add a custom domain later in project settings

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts
   - For production deployment: `vercel --prod`

### Configuration

The project includes a `vercel.json` file for optimal static site configuration.

**Note:** Make sure to update your EmailJS credentials in `script.js` before deploying if you want the contact form to work.
